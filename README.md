# TechFlow Solutions: Automation Governance & Sustainment Model

This repository contains the official framework for sustaining, governing, and ensuring the compliance of the automation platform at TechFlow Solutions.

## Overview

As our automation initiatives scale, a robust operational model is required to ensure our platform remains secure, reliable, and compliant. This repository documents that model, covering three core areas:

1.  **Sustainment**: How we monitor, maintain, and scale our automations.
2.  **Governance**: The roles, standards, and processes for managing change.
3.  **Compliance**: How we adhere to security and regulatory requirements.

## Core Documentation

The framework is detailed in the following documents:

* **[Sustainment Model](./docs/sustainment_model.md)**: Outlines our strategy for monitoring, failure handling, performance optimization, and scaling.
* **[Governance Framework](./docs/governance_model.md)**: Defines the roles, responsibilities, standards, and change management procedures for the platform.
* **[Compliance Strategy](./docs/compliance_strategy.md)**: Details our approach to managing regulatory risks and proving compliance.

## Supporting Resources
