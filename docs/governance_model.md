# Automation Governance Framework

## 1. Overview

The Governance Framework establishes clear ownership, standards, and processes for developing, deploying, and managing automations at TechFlow Solutions. Its purpose is to enable scalable growth of our automation platform while minimizing risk and ensuring high-quality, maintainable code.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

Clearly defined roles are essential for accountability and efficient workflow.

* **Automation Lead**: Owns the overall automation platform, strategy, and backlog. Responsible for prioritizing new automations, approving deployments to production, and managing the sustainment model.
* **Automation Developer**: Responsible for designing, developing, testing, and documenting automations according to established standards.
* **Business Process Owner**: A subject-matter expert from the business unit who owns the process being automated. They provide requirements, test user acceptance (UAT), and sign off on the automation's functionality.
* **IT/Security Auditor**: A stakeholder from the IT and security teams who periodically reviews automations for compliance with security policies, data privacy regulations, and resource usage standards.

## 3. Repository and Documentation Standards

Consistency across the codebase is critical for long-term maintainability.

* **README.md**: Every automation project must have a `README.md` file that includes:
    * A clear description of the bot's purpose.
    * Setup and installation instructions.
    * Configuration details (including all required environment variables).
    * Usage instructions.
* **Docstrings**: All Python functions and classes must have clear, descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
* **Structured Logging**: Logs must be in a structured (JSON) format and include a standard set of fields (`run_id`, `bot_name`, `status`, etc.) to ensure they are machine-readable and useful for monitoring.
* **Dependency Management**: Python dependencies must be explicitly defined in a `requirements.txt` file.

## 4. Change Management Procedure

All changes to production automations must follow a strict, auditable Git-based workflow.

1.  **Branching**: All work must be done on a feature branch, created from the `main` branch (e.g., `feature/TFS-123-invoice-processing-update`). Direct commits to `main` are blocked.
2.  **Pull Request (PR)**: When work is complete, the developer opens a Pull Request to merge the feature branch into `main`. The PR must include a description of the changes and a link to the corresponding work item.
3.  **Code Review**: The Automation Lead or another peer developer must review the PR. The review checks for adherence to coding standards, logic, and security practices. At least one approval is required.
4.  **Automated Testing**: The PR automatically triggers a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that runs automated unit tests. All tests must pass.
5.  **Merge and Deploy**: Once approved and tested, the Automation Lead merges the PR into `main`. This merge automatically triggers a deployment to the staging environment. Deployment to production requires a final manual approval.
6.  **Versioning**: Upon deployment to production, a Git tag is created (e.g., `v1.2.0`) to create an immutable snapshot of the deployed version.

## 5. Risk Management

* **Rollback Plan**: Because every production deployment is tied to a Git tag, rolling back to a previous stable version is a straightforward process of re-deploying the older tag.
* **Alerting on Failures**: As defined in the Sustainment Model, critical failures trigger immediate alerts.
* **Error Audit Trail**: All errors are logged centrally with a unique `run_id`, creating a clear and auditable trail for post-mortem analysis and compliance reviews.
